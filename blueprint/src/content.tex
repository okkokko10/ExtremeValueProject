% In this file you should put the actual content of the blueprint.
% It will be used both by the web and the print version.
% It should *not* include the \begin{document}

% If you want to split the blueprint content into several files then

This is a blueprint for a project which forms a part of the course
\emph{MS-EV0029 Introduction to Formalized Mathematics in Lean}
at Aalto University, running from February to June, 2025.
The goal is to formalize the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem,
classifying univariate extreme value distributions.
Contributions are welcome by course participants!

\textbf{WARNING: The blueprint is still work in progress!}
Contributions by the course participants
to improve the blueprint and add details
(which are helpful for formalization) are very welcome!
