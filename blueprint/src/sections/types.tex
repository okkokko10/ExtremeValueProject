  Two c.d.f.s $F, G$ are said to be of the same type, if
  there exists an order-preserving affine isomorphism $A \in \OriAffR$
  such that $G = A . F$.

  Being of the same type is an equivalence relation, and
  the equivalence classes are called types (of distributions on $\bR$).

\section{Convergence to types}

The notion of convergence of cumulative distribution functions
considered here is always taken to be pointwise convergence
on the set of continuity points of the limit c.d.f.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:convergence-in-distribution-with-cdf} and
Lemma~\ref{lem:cdf-convergence-from-convergence-in-distribution},
this corresponds to convergence in distribution (weak convergence
of probability measures). Below, when we write $F_n \tendsinlaw F$
for c.d.f.s $F_n$, $n \in \bN$, and $F$, this is always what we
mean.

For affine maps $A \colon \bR \to \bR$, we use the topology
of pointwise convergence of functions. Equivalently, convergence of affine maps
means the convergence of the coefficients $a, b \in \bR$ in the expression
$x \mapsto a x + b$ of the affine functions
(so $A_n \to A$ if and only if the functions are of the form
$A_n(x) = a_n x + b_n$ and $A(x) = a x + b$, and $a_n \to a$ and $b_n \to b$).

\begin{lemma}[Unique affine relation among two nondegenerate c.d.f.s]
  \label{lem:unique-affine-relation-cdf}

  Let $F, G$ be two c.d.f.s of the same type, and $A \in \OriAffR$
  an affine isomorphism such that $G = A.F$. If $F$ is nondegenerate,
  then $A$ is the only element of $\OriAffR$ for which the
  relation $G = A.F$ holds.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  % \uses{}
  % \leanok
  Since $F$ is nondegenerate, we can find two different points $x_1 < x_2$
  such that $0 < F(x_1) < F(x_2) \le 1$. By right continuity of $F$, we can
  assume these points to be taken minimal with the given values, i.e.,
  $x_j = \inf \big\{ x \in \bR \; \big| \; F(x) = F(x_j) \big\}$ for
  $j=1,2$.

  The assumption $G = A.F$ means $G(x) = F \big( A^{-1}(x) \big)$ for all $x \in \bR$.
  Therefore $G \big( A(x_1) \big) = F(x_1) < F(x_2) = G \big( A(x_2) \big)$.
  We also get $A(x_j) = \inf \big\{ y \in \bR \; \big| \; G(y) = F(x_j) \big\}$ for
  $j=1,2$ by strict monotonicity and bijectivity of $A$
  (if, for example, there would exist a $y'_2 < A(x_2)$ such that $G(y'_2) = F(x_2)$,
  then the point $x'_2 = A^{-1}(y'_2) < x_2$ would be such that
  $F\big(A^{-1}(y'_2)\big) = G(y'_2) = F(x_2)$, contradicting the minimality of $x_2$).

  If $\widetilde{A} \in \OriAffR$ is also such that $G = \widetilde{A}.F$, then
  the same holds for it:
  $\widetilde{A}(x_j) = \inf \big\{ y \in \bR \; \big| \; G(y) = F(x_j) \big\}$
  for $j=1,2$. We conclude that
  \begin{align*}
    \widetilde{A}(x_1) \, = \; &
        \inf \big\{ y \in \bR \; \big| \; G(y) = F(x_1) \big\} \; = \, A(x_1) \\
    \widetilde{A}(x_2) \, = \; &
        \inf \big\{ y \in \bR \; \big| \; G(y) = F(x_2) \big\} \; = \, A(x_2) .
  \end{align*}
  But an affine map of $\bR$ is determined by its values at two distinct points:
  from $a x_1 + b = y_1$ and $a x_2 + b = y_2$ with $x_1 \ne x_2$ one can solve $a, b$.
  Therefore we must have $\widetilde{A} = A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Degeneration by shrinking affine transformations]
  \label{lem:degenerate-shrinking-limit}

  Let $(F_n)_{n \in \bN}$ be a sequence of c.d.f.s which converges to a c.d.f. $G$,
  $F_n \tendsinlaw G$. Consider affine transformations of the form $A_n(x) = a_n x + b_n$,
  with $a_n > 0$ and $b_n \in \bR$, such that $a_n \to 0$ and $b_n \to \beta \in \bR$
  as $n \to \infty$. Then $A_n . F_n \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$, where
  $\widetilde{G}$ is the degenerate c.d.f. of the delta mass at $\beta$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  % \uses{}
  % \leanok
  It suffices to prove that for any $x < \beta$ we have $\widetilde{G}(x) = 0$
  and for any $x > \beta$ we have $\widetilde{G}(x) = 1$.

  Let us focus on the latter, so let $x > \beta$. Let also $\eps > 0$; we will prove
  that $\widetilde{G}(x) > 1 - \eps$, and the claim will follow.

  By density of continuity points of $\widetilde{G}$, we can choose $x'$ such that
  $\beta < x' < x$ and $\widetilde{G}$ is continuous at $x'$. Then the assumed
  convergence $A_n . F_n \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$ implies that
  $(A_n . F_n)(x') \to \widetilde{G}(x')$. Since $\widetilde{G}(x) \ge \widetilde{G}(x')$,
  it suffices to prove that $\widetilde{G}(x') > 1 - \eps$.

  Since $G$ is a c.d.f., we can choose a continuity point $z$ of $G$
  large enough so that $G(z) > 1 - \eps$.
  Then by the assumed convergence $F_n \tendsinlaw G$, we have
  $F_n(z) \to G(z)$. By definition we have
  \begin{align*}
    (A_n . F_n)(A_n(z)) \; = \; F_n \big( A_n^{-1} (A_n(z)) \big) \; = \; F_n(z)
      \; \longrightarrow \; G(z) . %\; > \;  1-\eps .
  \end{align*}
  Note that $A_n(z) = a_n z + b_n \to \beta$ as $n \to \infty$ by the assumptions
  $a_n \to 1$ and $b_n \to \beta$. In particular, for $n$ large enough,
  we have $A_n(z) < x'$.
  Therefore, for $n$ large enough
  \begin{align*}
    F_n(z) \; = \; (A_n . F_n) \big( A_n(z) \big) \; \le \; (A_n . F_n)(x') .
  \end{align*}
  The LHS tends to $G(z)$ and the RHS tends to $\widetilde{G}(x')$,
  showing
  \begin{align*}
    1 - \eps \; < \; G(z) \; \le \; \widetilde{G}(x') \; \le \; \widetilde{G}(x) .
  \end{align*}
  This concludes the proof that $\widetilde{G}(x) = 1$ for all $x > \beta$.

  The proof that $\widetilde{G}(x) = 0$ for all $x < \beta$ is similar.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Impossibility of expanding affine transformations]

  Let $(F_n)_{n \in \bN}$ be a sequence of c.d.f.s which converges to a nondegenerate
  c.d.f. $G$, $F_n \tendsinlaw G$. Consider affine transformations of the form $A_n(x) = a_n x + b_n$,
  with $a_n > 0$ and $b_n \in \bR$, such that $a_n \to +\infty$
  as $n \to \infty$. Then $A_n . F_n$ cannot converge to any c.d.f.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{lem:exists-two-nontrivial-continuity-pts-cdf}
  % \leanok
  Since $G$ is assumed nondegenerate, by Lemma~\ref{lem:exists-two-nontrivial-continuity-pts-cdf}
  we can pick two continuity points $x_1 < x_2$
  of $G$ such that $0 < G(x_1) \le G(x_2) < 1$. Then from the assumption
  $F_n \tendsinlaw G$ we get $F_n(x_1) \to G(x_1)$ and $F_n(x_2) \to G(x_2)$.

  Assume, by way of contradiction, that we have convergence
  $A_n . F \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$ to some c.d.f. $\widetilde{G}$.

  We claim that then $\big(A_n(x_1)\big)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded from below and
  $\big(A_n(x_2)\big)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded from above.
  Since
  \begin{align*}
    a_n = \frac{A_n(x_2) - A_n(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} ,
  \end{align*}
  this will show that $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded from above, contradicting
  the assumption $a_n \to +\infty$, and finishing the proof.

  To show that $\big(A_n(x_1)\big)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded from below,
  choose a continuity point $z$ of $\widetilde{G}$ such that
  $\widetilde{G}(z) < G(x_1)$. Then the assumed convergence
  $A_n . F \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$ implies
  $(A_n . F)(z) \to \widetilde{G}(z)$.
  On the other hand, if $\big(A_n(x_1)\big)_{n \in \bN}$ is not
  bounded from below, then along some subsequence $(n_k)_{k \in \bN}$ of indices
  we have $A_{n_k}(x_1) < z$, and for those indices we then have
  \begin{align*}
    F_{n_k}(x_1) \; = \; (A_{n_k} . F_{n_k}) \big( A_{n_k}(x_1) \big)
      \; \le \; (A_{n_k} . F_{n_k})(z) .
  \end{align*}
  The LHS tends to $G(x_1)$ as $k \to \infty$, whereas the RHS tends
  to $\widetilde{G}(z)$. We get $G(x_1) \le \widetilde{G}(z)$, contradicting
  the choice of $z$. This shows that $\big(A_n(x_1)\big)_{n \in \bN}$ must
  in fact be bounded from below.

  The proof that $\big(A_n(x_2)\big)_{n \in \bN}$ must be bounded from above
  is similar.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Convergence to types]
  \label{thm:convergence-to-types}
  \uses{def:degenerate-cdf, lem:oriented-affine-action-on-cdf, def:cdf-type}
  % \lean{}
  % \leanok
  Suppose that $(F_n)_{n \in \bN}$ is a sequence of
  c.d.f.s which converges to a nondegenerate c.d.f. $G$, i.e.,
  $F_n \tendsinlaw G$ as $n \to \infty$.
  Let $(A_n)_{n \in \bN}$ be a sequence of oriented
  affine isomorphisms of $\bR$, $A_n \in \OriAffR$
  such that $A_n.F_n \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$ for some c.d.f.
  $\widetilde{G}$.

  If we write $A_n(x) = a_n x + b_n$, then $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$
  and $(b_n)_{n \in \bN}$ are bounded sequences.

  If $\widetilde{G}$ is nondegenerate, then
  $A_n \to A \in \OriAffR$ and $A.G = \widetilde{G}$.
  In particular $G$ and $\widetilde{G}$ are of the same type.
  Moreover, $A$ is the unique affine transformation for which
  the equality $A.G = \widetilde{G}$ holds.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{lem:impossible-expanding-limit, lem:degenerate-shrinking-limit,
    lem:unique-affine-relation-cdf}
  % \leanok
  Let us first argue that $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$ are bounded.
  If not, then by passing to a subsequence, we have $a_{n_k} \to +\infty$.
  But since $F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw G$ and $G$ is nondegenerate,
  it contradicts Lemma~\ref{lem:impossible-expanding-limit}
  to have $A_{n_k} . F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$.
  Therefore $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$ must be bounded: there exists
  some $M>0$ such that $a_n \le M$ for all $n \in \bN$.

  Let us then argue that $(b_n)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded.
  If not, then we can extract a subsequence such
  that either $b_{n_k} \to -\infty$ or $b_{n_k} \to +\infty$.
  Let us prove the impossibility of the second one, the first is similar.
  So assume that $b_{n_k} \to +\infty$.
  Since $G$ is nondegenerate, we may pick a continuity point $x_0$
  of $G$ such that $0 < G(x_0) < 1$. Then we have $F_n(x_0) \to G(x_0)$
  by the assumption $F_n \tendsinlaw G$.
  We may also pick a continuity point $z$ of $\widetilde{G}$
  such that $\widetilde{G}(z) > G(x_0)$. Then we have
  $(A_n.F_n)(z) \to \widetilde{G}(z)$
  by the assumption $A_n.F_n \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$.
  But $A_{n_k}(x_0) = a_{n_k} x_0 + b_{n_k} \to +\infty$, since $0 < a_{n_k} \le M$
  and $b_{n_k} \to +\infty$. Therefore we have for all large enough $k$
  that $A_{n_k}(x_0) > z$. And then
  \begin{align*}
    (A_{n_k}.F_{n_k})(z) \; \le \; (A_{n_k}.F_{n_k})\big(A_{n_k}(x_0)\big) \; = \; F_{n_k}(x_0) .
  \end{align*}
  The LHS tends to $\widetilde{G}(z)$ as $k \to \infty$, and the RHS tends to $G(x_0)$.
  Therefore we get $\widetilde{G}(z) \le G(x_0)$, contradicting the choice of $z$.
  This shows that we cannot have $b_{n_k} \to +\infty$. Similarly one proves that
  we cannot have $b_{n_k} \to -\infty$. We conclude that $(b_n)_{n \in \bN}$
  is indeed bounded.

  From now on, suppose furthermore that also $\widetilde{G}$ is nondegenerate.
  We claim that then $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded away from $0$:
  for some $\eps > 0$ we have $a_n \ge \eps$ for all $n \in \bN$.
  If not, then we could extract a subsequence such that $a_{n_k} \to 0$
  and also $b_n \to \beta$ (since $b_n$ is bounded).
  But since $F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw G$ and $G$ is nondegenerate,
  from Lemma~\ref{lem:degenerate-shrinking-limit}
  we would get $A_{n_k} . F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}_0$,
  where $\widetilde{G}_0$ is degenerate. But by assumption
  $A_{n_k} . F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$, where
  $\widetilde{G}$ is nondegenerate; this is impossible by uniqueness
  of limits for convergence in distribution. Therefore
  $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$ must indeed be bounded away from $0$.

  Note that since $(a_n)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded away from $0$ and $+\infty$,
  and $(b_n)_{n \in \bN}$ is bounded, we can extract a subsequence such that
  $a_{n_k} \to \alpha \in (0,+\infty)$ and $b_{n_k} \to \beta \in \bR$.
  By assumption, we have $A_{n_k} . F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw \widetilde{G}$.
  But since $A_{n_k} \to A$ where $A(x) = \alpha x + \beta$
  and we have also assumed $F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw G$, this implies by
  continuity that $A_{n_k} . F_{n_k} \tendsinlaw A . G$.
  By uniqueness of limits, we get $A . G = \widetilde{G}$.

  To prove that in fact $A_n \to A$, not just along a subsequence, note the
  following. From any subsequence $A_{n_k}$, we can extract a further
  convergent subsequence of values of $a_{n_{k_\ell}}$ and $b_{n_{k_\ell}}$
  values as above, with limits $\alpha' \in (0,+\infty)$
  and $\beta' \in \bR$. The same argument as above shows that
  $A' . G = \widetilde{G}$ where $A'(x) = \alpha' x + \beta'$.
  Lemma~\ref{lem:unique-affine-relation-cdf} then says that we must have
  $A' = A$, i.e., $\alpha' = \alpha$ and $\beta' = \beta$. Since any
  subsequence has a convergent further subsequence with the same limit,
  the entire sequence must converge, $A_n \to A$.
  The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

  An orientation-preserving affine transformation $A \in \OriAffR$
  belongs to the subgroup fixing $c \in \bR$ if and only if $A(c) = c$.

  \emph{(Note that the subgroup is a priori defined as the image of a homomorphism,
  so the statement indeed requires a proof.)}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  % \uses{}
  % \leanok
  Suppose first that $A$ is an element of the said subgroup, i.e.,
  $A(x) = e^{s} (x - c) + c$ for some $s \in \bR$. Then clearly $A(c) = c$.

  Suppose then that $A(c) = c$. Write $A(x) = a x + b$ for $a>0$ and $b \in \bR$.
  Plug in $x=c$ in the assumed fixed point property to obtain
  \begin{align*}
    a c + b = c .
  \end{align*}
  The above can be solved to give $b = (1-a)c$.
  Also since $a>0$, we can write $a = e^s$ with $s \in \bR$.
  With these, the formula for $A$ simplifies to
  \begin{align*}
    A(x) = e^s x + c (1 - e^s) = e^s \big( x - c \big) + c .
  \end{align*}
  This shows $A = A_s$ as desired (with $A_s$ as in Definition~\ref{def:fixing-subgroup}).

  with $\beta > 0$.

  \begin{align*}
    G(x) = \exp \Big( - \exp \big( -\beta^{-1} x + d \big) \Big) .

  Since $G$ is nondegenerate, there exists an $x_0 \in \bR$
  with $0 < G(x_0) < 1$. Write $q = -\log G(x_0) > 0$,
  so that $G(x_0) = e^{-q}$.

  For $t > 0$, from the equation $G^{t} = A_t . G$
  we get for any $x \in \bR$
  \begin{align*}
  G(x)^t = G \big( A_t^{-1}(x) \big) = G \big( x - \beta \, \log(t) \big) .
  \end{align*}
  In particular, with $x = x_0 + \beta \, \log(t)$, we get
  \begin{align*}
    G\big( x_0 + \beta \, \log(t) \big)^{t} = G(x_0) = e^{- q},
  \end{align*}
  from which we can solve
  \begin{align*}
    G\big( x_0 + \beta \, \log(t) \big) = e^{-q/t} .
  \end{align*}
  The above holds for any $t>0$, and any $x \in \bR$
  can be written as $x = x_0 + \beta \, \log\big( e^{(x - x_0)/\beta} \big)$.
  We therefore get, for any $x \in \bR$,
  \begin{align*}
    G(x) = \exp \Big( - q \, \exp \big( -(x-x_0)/\beta \big) \Big) .
  \end{align*}
  This is of the desired form, with $d = \frac{x_0}{\beta} + \log(q)$.
  Plugging in $x = 0$ then shows $d = \log \big(-\log G(0) \big)$.

  so the above implies $G(x)^2 = G(A_2^{-1}(x)) \ge G(x)$.
  This not possible if $0 < G(x) < 1$, so we must in particular have $x_0 > c$.

  With $x = A_t(x_0)$ in the above equation, %= t^{\alpha} (x_0-c) + c$,
  we get
  \begin{align*}
    G\big( A_t(x_0) \big)^{t} = G(x_0) = e^{- q},
